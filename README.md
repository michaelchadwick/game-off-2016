## Axeracer

![Axeracer gameplay](https://neb.host/games/pico8/axeracer/axeracer_gameplay.png)

Axeracer is a 1-player, overhead racing game where you drive a bug-like creature around a track. It has axes for antennae, all the better for *hacking* away the grass in its way to the finish line. The game goes on infinitely, so keep trying to beat your past lap time!

**[Play Axeracer](https://neb.host/games/pico8/axeracer/axeracer.html) on the web now!**

### Controls

**Up** - accelerate
**Left/Right** - rotate
**Down** - reverse
**Z** - hold down while accelerating for a boost

### Technology

[Pico-8](http://lexaloffle.com/pico8.php) powers this retro arcade game. Load the `.p8` file into Pico-8 to see/modify the source of the game and do whatever you want with it.

## The Challenge

*I* have the entire month of November to create a game *loosely* based on the theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

What do[es] *Github* mean by **loosely** based on hacking, modding and/or augmenting? They literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be:

* an endless runner where you *hack* down binary trees in your path with a pixelated axe,
* a *modern* take on a classic e.g. a roguelike set in a 3D or VR world, or
* an *augmented* reality game bringing octopus/cat hybrids into the real world.

*I'm going to* work *alone* ~~or with a team~~ and build for (some as-of-yet undecided) platform or device. The use of open source game engines and libraries is encouraged but not required.

*Github* will highlight some of *their* favorites on the GitHub blog, and the world will get to enjoy (and maybe even contribute to and/or learn from) *my* creation~~s~~.

## How to participate

* ~~[Sign up for a free personal account][github-signup] if you don't already have one.~~
* ~~Fork [this repository][game-off-repo] to *my* personal account (or to a [free organization account][github-signup-org]).~~

* ~~Update the `README.md` file to include a description of *my* game, how/where to play/download it, how to build/compile it, what dependencies it has, etc.~~
* ~~Submit *my* final game using this [form][wufoo-form].~~
